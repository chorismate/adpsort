adpsort

adpsort (adaptive sort) is a fast adaptive sorting algorithm.
This repository contains the (single-file) reference implementation.
It sorts integers in C.

Note: chorismate/orxsort may be faster but is not a comparison sort.


Objectives
- Have a best-case performance of O(n).
- Have a worst-case performance of O(n log n).
- Perform faster in practice compared with as many other sorts as possible.


Current implementation
To be written.
